# Data Engineering - Universe screening using Screener and RD Search


## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
Data engineering is one of the most important phases in an artificial intelligence pipeline, without the appropriate data in place no AI system can deliver business value. The first stage of data engineering is the ingestion phase, gathering the appropriate data from existing data sources. This phase together with the feature engineering phase often times dominates the AI pipeline delivery timeframes and can account for half if not more of the project's lifetime. Luckily, the LSEG Refinitiv Data and Analytics ecosystem, has already done most of the engineering work for you. Whether through providing a friendly user experience via Workspace or easy to use APIs, an immensely rich data universe with prety much any type of data that an AI project could need is available at your fingertips. 

Whats even more important, through complex background processes that remain transparent to our end-users, all the data is consistent, clean and ready to be used out of the box, the LSEG Refinitiv team has done all the heavy lifting for you, to ensure a high quality and already curated dataspace. Furthermore, a rich meta data ecosystem accompanies the data through smart tagging allowing for rapid deployment of complex data science concepts.

This blueprint will take you through the different methodologies LSEG Refinitiv D&A produts offer so you can get the data you need in place and quickly move on to the next steps of your AI pipeline towards delivery of your AI systems.
